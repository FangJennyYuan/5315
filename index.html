      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is an open source tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Dockerâ€™s containers are very similar to a Virtual Machine (VM), except it shares the Host operating system. Whereas VM has its own operating system, bins, and libraries. Containers are isolated but share operating systems and depending on the project, might share bins or libraries.
